This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
  
For installing the dependencies, go to the project directory and from cli, run:  

``npm install``  

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npx next dev
#or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

For running the app in build version instead of development, run:  
``npx next build``   
followed by  
``npx next start``
